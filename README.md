Tomato Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
Project Description:

This project aims to classify different types of diseases in tomato plants using deep learning techniques. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model can accurately identify various tomato plant diseases from images. The dataset, which contains labeled images of tomato leaves with different diseases, is uploaded to a GitHub repository. The code automatically downloads, unzips, and uses this dataset to train and evaluate the model.

Key Features:

Dataset Access: The dataset is hosted on a GitHub branch. The code includes functionality to download the zip file from the branch, upload it to Google Drive, and automatically unzip it for use in the project.
Deep Learning Model: A CNN is implemented to classify the images into different disease categories. The model is trained using labeled images of tomato leaves.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure it effectively classifies the diseases.
