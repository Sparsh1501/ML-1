This project employs sophisticated Linear Regression techniques to predict water pollution levels resulting from chemical disposal into aquatic environments. The model, crafted through advanced statistical modeling, establishes correlations between various chemical parameters and water quality. Meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering contribute to a precise prediction of pollution levels.

Integrating real-time and historical environmental data enhances the model's accuracy, allowing it to capture both immediate and temporal pollutant effects. This predictive framework holds significant implications for environmental monitoring, providing a quantifiable tool to anticipate and manage the consequences of chemical disposal in water bodies.

The project's commitment to leveraging Linear Regression showcases an advanced statistical approach, contributing to environmental stewardship and sustainable resource management. This sophisticated application of predictive modeling underscores the project's dedication to addressing the dynamic challenges of water pollution with precision and insight.
